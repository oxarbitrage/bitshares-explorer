## Roadmap to version 1

Date: 2017-07-28

Author: oxarbitrage

Roadmap to version 1 is simply the time to finish the TODO list:

https://github.com/oxarbitrage/bitshares-explorer/blob/master/TODO.md

The list is all the bugs/fixes/additions i was able to find in the PoC of the explorer project located at: http://bitshares-explorer.io 

The estimated time for completition of all the items in the list is of 2 weeks with full time dedication. As the explorer is just part of my duties as an active Bitshares worker(see worker proposal https://github.com/oxarbitrage/worker-proposals/blob/master/bitshares2017.md approved by stakeholders) i am estimating 4 weeks to get all the TODO list done splitting the time 50-50 for 1 month between the explorer and core development tasks.

This roadmap can change if extraordinary core/network problems happend during the 1 month period that requires my services fully somewhere else. This is unlikely but if this is the case, the roadmap calendar will be ajusted.

Additional bugs/fixes/additions found by myself or by any other will be trated as github issue and will be done in a later stage. The proposed TODO is closed and no new items will be added, only checks in the completed tasks. Everything outside the TODO is for a second stage and outside the estimated timeframes.
